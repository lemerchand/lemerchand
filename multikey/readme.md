## Introduction
Okay...So maybe you are interested in consolidating your action bindings to a smaller part of your keyboard, or perhaps you want to try a more mnemonic approach to your keys to make it easier to remember them. Cool. That's what this script is all about. 

## Features
- Assign an action or multiple actions to a string of keys
- Combine actions from both the Midi Editor and Trackview
- A (possibly) quicker way of making custom actions
- Assign bindings in a mnemonic way

## Caveats
